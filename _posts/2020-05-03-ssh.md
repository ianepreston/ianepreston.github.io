# Managing SSH keys for a home network

## Introduction

This guide covers how I set up and manage ssh keys on my home network. It's not meant as an explainer on what ssh is or why you should use it, more a recipe for how I do things.

## Who this is for

Mostly me so I remember how to do this if I have to rebuild my network, or want to add new clients. I'm not an expert in security, so definitely do your own research before implementing any of this, and I would certainly say that this is a hobbyist implementation in general and not suitable for an organization.

I got the inspiration for this from [How to SSH properly](https://gravitational.com/blog/how-to-ssh-properly/). It's a nice and thorough guide, but it's a bit enterprise oriented for my purposes. The idea here will be to make something that's more maintainable for a local setup.

## The actual process

The idea is to have my certificate authority keys live on a USB drive. That way when I set up a new machine I can plug in the drive and sign the keys, and then the rest of the time the keys are completely removed from network access. As long as I'm smart and don't lose/destroy the USB drive it seems like a great idea. The main advantage from just using regular keys rather than signing them is that I don't have to add a line to ```authorized_keys``` on every host every time I add a client, and I can keep a nice clean ```known_hosts``` on each of my clients. For this example my host machine will be named ```mars``` and the client machine will be named ```luna```. I'll do the preliminary setup from ```luna```, but any machine should be fine.

### Get the drive ready

I have a 64GB USB key that I'm going to store the CAs on. That's way too big for what I need, and I wouldn't mind having it handy to shuttle other files around (I'm not going to be taking it anywhere, on account of it has CAs for my network on it, but still). So I created a big exfat partition that took up most of the disk for files and such, along with a 200MB ntfs partition right at the end for storing keys. I went with exfat for the storage partition because it's readable in both Windows and Linux (once you install ```exfat-utils``` and ```exfat-fuse```), is designed for flash media, and can handle large files. I went with NTFS for the secrets partition because I have to have file permissions on the private keys or it won't work, and windows machines won't read EXT4. It does mean I'll have to install NTFS support on any Linux boxes I want to run it from, which is a hassle, but I can live with that.

### Generate CA keys

From the usb drive:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f user_ca -C user_ca
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f host_ca -C host_ca
```

Generate a host and user signing key using ed25519 encryption. Generates public private key pairs named host/user_ca and host/user_ca.pub for the public keys. RSA is the default, but all of my systems support ed25519 and I understand it's better in terms of security and performance so I might as well take this opportunity to update.

#### Generate known_hosts file

This will go in the ```~/.ssh``` folder of clients in order to validate access.

```bash
echo -n "@cert-authority * " > known_hosts
cat host_ca.pub >> known_hosts
```

### Generate the host key and sign it

For any machines that I want to be able to ssh into I need to generate and sign a host key. From the same folder as the CA keys were generated:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f mars_host_ed25519_key
ssh-keygen -s host_ca -I mars -h mars_host_ed25519_key.pub
```

#### WARNING: DO NOT PUT A PASSPHRASE ON HOST KEYS

The first line operates the same as before. The second line signs the public key. ```-I mars``` is the certificate's identity, apparently it can be used to revoke a certificate in the future although I'm not totally clear on how at this point. You can use the ```-n``` flag to specify which hostname in particular this key is valid for but I don't really see the need in as small a setup as I'm doing. ```-h``` identifies this as a host key.

At the end of this, three new files are generated: ```mars_host_ed25519_key```, ```mars_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub```, and ```mars_host_ed25519_key.pub```.

### Configure SSH to use host certificates

Move the three generated files from the last section and copy ```user_ca.pub``` to ```/etc/ssh``` on your host and set the permissions to match the other files there. In this example I've physically moved the key over to the host machine and mounted it. If your host currently has ssh enabled with password based authentication you could ```scp``` it over instead:

```bash
sudo mv mars_host_ed25519_key* /etc/ssh/
sudo cp user_ca.pub /etc/ssh/
cd /etc/ssh/
sudo chown root:root mars_host*
sudo chown root:root user_ca.pub
sudo chmod 644 mars_host*
sudo chmod 600 mars_host_ed25519_key # stricter private key permissions
sudo chmod 644 user_ca.pub
```

Next, edit ```/etc/ssh/sshd_config``` to have the lines

```bash
HostKey /etc/ssh/mars_host_ed25519_key
HostCertificate /etc/ssh/mars_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub
TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/user_ca.pub
```

There was a commented out line in the file for ```HostKey``` so I put it below there. Placement shouldn't really matter but it will hopefully be easier to find if I have to track this file down later.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

Once you're sure everything is working you'll want to disable password authentication. Be aware that if you screw up keys and have the second line set you'll have to physically connect to the machine to resolve it. For my home network this is no big deal, but just be aware. Go into ```/etc/ssh/sshd_config``` and set the following lines and restart ssh again:

```bash
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
```

### Create user key

Still in the folder with the ca key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -f luna_ed25519 -t ed25519
ssh-keygen -s user_ca -I ian@luna -n admin,ipreston,pi luna_ed25519.pub
mv luna* ~/.ssh/
cp known_hosts ~/.ssh/
```

The only new flag in this is ```-n ipreston,admin,pi``` which is the comma separated list of users I want this to be valid for. In addition to the username I set up on my server I want this key to be able to connect to my pfsense admin user and my raspberry pi, which I generally just leave with the default ```pi``` user.

### Give it a test drive

At this point if everything is configured correctly you should be able to ssh from your client to your host and only be prompted for the passkey you set (or without any prompting if you didn't set a passkey)

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/luna_ed25519 ipreston@mars
```

### Set up an ssh config file

If that all worked the next step will be to set a nice alias to save some typing in the future.

```bash
touch ~/.ssh/config
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
```

In ```config```:

```bash
Host mars
    User ipreston
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/luna_ed25519
```

There are lots of other options you can set in that config but that's all I need for my setup. After that all you should need to type is ```ssh mars``` to be connected to your host with the right user and using the correct authentication.

## External servers

There's no real sense in signing keys for external services. For example, I use GitHub with SSH, but they only allow CA authentication for enterprise (fair enough). There's also no particular reason to re-use my LAN keys for GitHub, so I created a new key and set ```~/.ssh/config``` to use the correct identity automatically:

Use the same commands as the user key setup stage, except don't bother signing the key. Add the public key to GitHub as you normally would ([GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)) and then edit ```~/.ssh/config``` to add something like the following:

```bash
Host github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/luna_github_ed25519
    HostName github.com
    User git
```

## Android

I don't ssh a ton from Android, but every so often it's handy to be able to do. My former go-to app was Connectbot, but I never really liked how it managed keys, and I couldn't get it to work with the CA. I ended up going with termux. To set it up:

* Generate and sign keys as normal.
* copy the key pairs, ```config``` and ```known_hosts``` onto your android device
* Install termux (it's in the play store)
* Open termux
* Install openssh with ```pkg install openssh```
* Allow access to internal storage with ```termux-setup-storage``` and accepting the request
* Navigate to where you copied the files (somewhere in ```~/storage/shared```) and copy them to ```~/.ssh``` using ```cp```, it's just regular bash in termux.
* Everything should work, try connecting to a host.

## Conclusion and ToDo

That's basically it, whenever I add a new client or host I can connect the USB key and follow the appropriate steps. All previously configured clients or hosts will automatically have the correct permissions.

### ToDo

As I learn more about automation I might find better ways to generate and deploy these keys. I have it on my list to learn Ansible. I know it needs SSH set up to start, but maybe I can set it up to use password authentication to copy over and configure some signed certificates. If nothing else I could write some bash scripts to save some typing, but I want to play around with Ansible before I go that route.
